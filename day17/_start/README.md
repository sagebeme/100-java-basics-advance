## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 17 exercises and projects. This is where you begin building a complete quiz application using OOP principles.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Question.java` - Starter code for Question class
- `QuizBrain.java` - Starter code for QuizBrain class
- `QuizApp.java` - Starter code for main application

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 17, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with basic OOP from Day 16
- **Ready** to build multi-class applications
- **Curious** about class relationships
- **Unsure** about organizing multiple classes

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Multiple Class Design**
   - How to organize classes
   - Class responsibilities
   - Class relationships
   - **Tip**: Each class should have one clear purpose

2. **Data Modeling**
   - Representing real-world concepts
   - Question as a class
   - Quiz logic as separate class
   - **Tip**: Model real-world entities as classes

3. **Class Communication**
   - How classes interact
   - Passing data between classes
   - Method calls across classes
   - **Tip**: Use method parameters and return values

### What to Focus On

✅ **Multiple classes** - Organizing code across classes
✅ **Data modeling** - Representing concepts as classes
✅ **Class relationships** - How classes work together
✅ **Clean architecture** - Well-organized code structure

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 3-4 hours
- **Multi-class design**: Takes practice to see relationships
- **Data modeling**: Think about real-world representation

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Multiple classes** - Organize code logically
- **Data modeling** - Classes represent concepts
- **Separation of concerns** - Each class has one job
- **Class collaboration** - Classes work together

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Design multiple classes
- [ ] Model data as classes
- [ ] Make classes work together
- [ ] Organize code cleanly

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **One class, one purpose** - Keep classes focused
- **Model real-world** - Classes represent entities
- **Clear relationships** - Understand how classes connect
- **Test each class** - Verify each works independently
