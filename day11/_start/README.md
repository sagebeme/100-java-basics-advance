# Day 11 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 11 exercises and projects. This is where you begin building the Blackjack game - a complex capstone project combining many concepts.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Blackjack.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 11, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with arrays, loops, methods, and conditionals
- **Ready** to build a complex game
- **Curious** about game state management
- **Unsure** about handling complex game logic

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Complex Game Logic**
   - Card dealing and tracking
   - Score calculation
   - Ace handling (1 or 11)
   - Win/lose conditions
   - **Tip**: Break game into phases - deal, player turn, dealer turn, compare

2. **Game State Management**
   - Tracking player and dealer hands
   - Managing scores
   - Handling bust conditions
   - **Tip**: Use ArrayList for hands, separate methods for phases

3. **Ace Handling**
   - Ace can be 1 or 11
   - Adjusting based on total
   - Preventing bust
   - **Tip**: Start with 11, reduce to 1 if needed

### What to Focus On

✅ **Game phases** - Deal, player turn, dealer turn, compare
✅ **Score calculation** - Handle Aces correctly
✅ **State management** - Track hands and scores
✅ **Game flow** - Proper turn sequence

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 4-5 hours (this is a capstone!)
- **Complex logic**: Takes time to think through all cases
- **Game phases**: Break into manageable pieces

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Game phases** - Structure game into clear phases
- **Ace handling** - Dynamic value adjustment
- **State tracking** - Manage all game variables
- **Complex conditionals** - Multiple win/lose scenarios

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Structure game into phases
- [ ] Calculate scores with Ace handling
- [ ] Manage game state
- [ ] Handle all win/lose conditions

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Break into methods** - dealCard(), calculateScore(), etc.
- **Handle Aces last** - Adjust after calculating base score
- **Test each phase** - Verify each part works
- **Clear variable names** - playerCards, dealerCards, etc.
