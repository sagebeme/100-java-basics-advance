# Day 26 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 26 exercises and projects. This is where you begin working with Streams and Lambda Expressions - modern Java functional programming.

## 📁 Files Included

- `NATOPhonetic.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 26, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with collections and loops
- **Ready** to learn functional programming
- **Curious** about streams and lambdas
- **Unsure** about when to use streams vs loops

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Lambda Syntax**
   - Arrow notation (->)
   - Parameter types
   - Return values
   - **Tip**: (parameter) -> expression or { statements }

2. **Stream API**
   - Creating streams
   - Intermediate operations
   - Terminal operations
   - **Tip**: Stream operations are lazy until terminal operation

3. **Functional Thinking**
   - Declarative vs imperative
   - Method chaining
   - Immutability
   - **Tip**: Think "what" not "how"

### What to Focus On

✅ **Lambda expressions** - Anonymous functions
✅ **Stream operations** - map, filter, collect
✅ **Method chaining** - Fluent API style
✅ **Functional style** - Declarative programming

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 2-3 hours
- **Lambdas**: Once syntax is clear, becomes natural
- **Streams**: Practice helps with understanding

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Lambdas** - Anonymous functions
- **Streams** - Sequence of elements
- **Operations** - Intermediate and terminal
- **Method references** - Shorthand for lambdas

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Write lambda expressions
- [ ] Create and use streams
- [ ] Chain stream operations
- [ ] Collect results

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Lambdas simplify code** - Less boilerplate
- **Streams are powerful** - Process collections easily
- **Method chaining** - Read left to right
- **Practice with examples** - Start simple
