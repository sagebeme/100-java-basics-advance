# Day 22 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 22 exercises and projects. This is where you begin building the classic Pong game.

## 📁 Files Included

- `PongGame.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 22, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with game development from previous days
- **Ready** to build a two-player game
- **Curious** about physics simulation
- **Unsure** about ball mechanics and paddle movement

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Physics Simulation**
   - Ball movement and bouncing
   - Angle calculations
   - Speed management
   - **Tip**: Use velocity vectors (speedX, speedY)

2. **Paddle Movement**
   - Two-player controls
   - Boundary checking
   - Smooth movement
   - **Tip**: Different keys for each player

3. **Collision Detection**
   - Ball-paddle collision
   - Ball-wall collision
   - Scoring detection
   - **Tip**: Check ball position against paddle bounds

### What to Focus On

✅ **Physics** - Ball velocity and bouncing
✅ **Two-player controls** - Separate key bindings
✅ **Collision detection** - Paddle and wall collisions
✅ **Scoring system** - Track points for each player

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 3-4 hours
- **Physics**: Takes practice to feel right
- **Two-player**: Adds complexity

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Velocity vectors** - Speed in X and Y directions
- **Bouncing logic** - Reverse direction on collision
- **Two-player input** - Separate controls
- **Scoring zones** - Detect when ball passes paddle

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Implement ball physics
- [ ] Handle paddle movement
- [ ] Detect collisions
- [ ] Track scores

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Velocity vectors** - Separate X and Y speeds
- **Bounce on collision** - Reverse appropriate direction
- **Two sets of keys** - W/S for player 1, Up/Down for player 2
- **Scoring zones** - Check if ball passes paddle
