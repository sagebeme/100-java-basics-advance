# Day 29 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 29 exercises and projects. This is where you begin building a password manager with file I/O.

## 📁 Files Included

- `PasswordManager.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 29, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with JavaFX GUI and file I/O
- **Ready** to build a complete application
- **Curious** about data persistence
- **Unsure** about password generation and storage

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Password Generation**
   - Random character selection
   - Character sets (letters, numbers, symbols)
   - Length configuration
   - **Tip**: Use Random with character string

2. **File I/O**
   - Saving passwords to file
   - Loading from file
   - File format
   - **Tip**: Use simple format like pipe-separated

3. **Data Management**
   - Storing password entries
   - Displaying list
   - Adding/removing entries
   - **Tip**: Use ArrayList to store entries

### What to Focus On

✅ **Password generation** - Random secure passwords
✅ **File I/O** - Save and load data
✅ **Data structure** - Organize password entries
✅ **GUI integration** - Connect file I/O to UI

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 3-4 hours
- **File I/O**: Once pattern is clear, straightforward
- **Data management**: Takes practice to organize

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Password generation** - Random character selection
- **File persistence** - Save/load data
- **Data structures** - Organize entries
- **GUI integration** - Connect all parts

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Generate random passwords
- [ ] Save data to file
- [ ] Load data from file
- [ ] Display in GUI

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Random passwords** - Use character sets
- **Simple file format** - Pipe-separated works well
- **ArrayList for entries** - Easy to manage
- **Always handle exceptions** - File operations can fail
