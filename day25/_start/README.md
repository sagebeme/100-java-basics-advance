# Day 25 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 25 exercises and projects. This is where you begin working with CSV data - parsing and processing structured data.

## 📁 Files Included

- `StatesGame.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 25, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with file I/O from Day 24
- **Ready** to work with structured data
- **Curious** about CSV format
- **Unsure** about parsing CSV data

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **CSV Parsing**
   - Reading CSV files
   - Splitting by commas
   - Handling headers
   - **Tip**: Use split(",") to parse CSV lines

2. **Data Processing**
   - Storing CSV data
   - Accessing columns
   - Data validation
   - **Tip**: Use ArrayList or arrays to store rows

3. **Game Logic**
   - Using CSV data in game
   - Tracking guesses
   - Validation logic
   - **Tip**: Store states in ArrayList, check against it

### What to Focus On

✅ **CSV parsing** - Reading and splitting CSV data
✅ **Data structures** - Storing and accessing data
✅ **Game logic** - Using data in application
✅ **Validation** - Checking user input

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 2-3 hours
- **CSV parsing**: Once pattern is clear, straightforward
- **Data processing**: Practice helps with organization

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **CSV format** - Comma-separated values
- **String split()** - Parsing CSV lines
- **Data storage** - ArrayList for rows
- **Data validation** - Check against dataset

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Parse CSV files
- [ ] Store CSV data
- [ ] Access data columns
- [ ] Use data in application

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **split(",")** - Easy CSV parsing
- **Skip headers** - Read first line separately
- **ArrayList for data** - Easy to search and validate
- **Data validation** - Check against loaded data
