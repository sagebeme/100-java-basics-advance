## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 14 exercises and projects. This is where you begin building the Higher Lower game - comparing data and tracking scores.

## 📁 Files Included

- `HigherLowerGame.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 14, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with HashMap, loops, and conditionals
- **Ready** to build a comparison-based game
- **Curious** about data organization
- **Unsure** about comparison logic and scoring

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Data Organization**
   - Storing name-value pairs
   - Organizing comparison data
   - Random selection
   - **Tip**: Use HashMap for name-value pairs

2. **Comparison Logic**
   - Comparing two values
   - Determining correct answer
   - Handling user guesses
   - **Tip**: Compare values, check user guess matches

3. **Score Tracking**
   - Tracking correct guesses
   - Game continuation
   - Win/lose conditions
   - **Tip**: Increment score on correct guess

### What to Focus On

✅ **Data structures** - HashMap for organizing data
✅ **Comparison logic** - Comparing and determining winner
✅ **Score tracking** - Managing game score
✅ **Game flow** - Continuous gameplay

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 2-3 hours
- **Data organization**: Once structure is clear, straightforward
- **Comparison logic**: Takes practice to get right

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **HashMap for data** - Organize name-value pairs
- **Comparison logic** - Compare and determine winner
- **Score tracking** - Increment on correct guesses
- **Game flow** - Continue until wrong guess

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Organize data with HashMap
- [ ] Compare values correctly
- [ ] Track score properly
- [ ] Handle game flow

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **HashMap for data** - Perfect for name-value pairs
- **Clear comparison** - Compare values, check guess
- **Track score** - Increment on correct answers
- **Random selection** - Use Random for variety
