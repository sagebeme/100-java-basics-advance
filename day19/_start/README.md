# Day 19 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 19 exercises and projects. This is where you begin working with inheritance and building animated games.

## 📁 Files Included

- `TurtleRace.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 19, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with OOP basics and JavaFX
- **Ready** to learn inheritance
- **Curious** about animation and game loops
- **Unsure** about how inheritance works in practice

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Inheritance Concepts**
   - extends keyword
   - Parent-child relationships
   - Method overriding
   - **Tip**: Child classes inherit from parent classes

2. **Animation Loops**
   - Thread-based animation
   - Platform.runLater() for JavaFX
   - Frame updates
   - **Tip**: Use threads for continuous updates

3. **Game State Management**
   - Tracking multiple objects
   - Updating positions
   - Rendering each frame
   - **Tip**: Separate update() and draw() methods

### What to Focus On

✅ **Inheritance** - extends keyword, super keyword
✅ **Animation** - Thread-based game loops
✅ **State management** - Tracking multiple objects
✅ **Game development** - Update and render cycle

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 3-4 hours
- **Inheritance**: Takes practice to see benefits
- **Animation**: Once pattern is clear, becomes natural

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Inheritance** - Classes can extend other classes
- **Animation loops** - Continuous update and render
- **Thread safety** - Platform.runLater() for JavaFX
- **Game state** - Track all moving objects

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Understand inheritance basics
- [ ] Create animation loops
- [ ] Update and render game state
- [ ] Handle multiple objects

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Inheritance reuses code** - Child classes get parent features
- **Animation needs threads** - Don't block UI thread
- **Separate update/draw** - Clean game loop structure
- **Track all state** - Every moving object needs tracking

**Remember**: Inheritance makes code reusable and organized! 🎉
