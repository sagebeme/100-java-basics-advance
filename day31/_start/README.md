## 📁 Files Included

- `FlashCardApp.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 31, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with JavaFX, file I/O, and OOP
- **Ready** to build a complete application
- **Curious** about combining all concepts
- **Unsure** about application architecture

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Application Architecture**
   - Organizing code
   - Data model design
   - UI and logic separation
   - **Tip**: Separate data, UI, and logic

2. **Card Management**
   - Storing flashcards
   - Current card tracking
   - Navigation between cards
   - **Tip**: Use ArrayList and index

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Save/load flashcards
   - Progress tracking
   - File format
   - **Tip**: Simple format works well

4. **User Experience**
   - Flip card functionality
   - Mark as known/unknown
   - Clear interface
   - **Tip**: Make interactions intuitive

### What to Focus On

✅ **Application structure** - Organize code well
✅ **Card management** - Store and navigate cards
✅ **Data persistence** - Save/load progress
✅ **User experience** - Intuitive interface

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 4-5 hours (this is a capstone!)
- **Architecture**: Takes time to design well
- **Complete app**: Combines many concepts

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Application design** - Structure and organization
- **Data model** - FlashCard class
- **State management** - Current card, known status
- **Complete application** - All features working

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Design application structure
- [ ] Manage card data
- [ ] Implement flip functionality
- [ ] Save/load data

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Plan structure first** - Design before coding
- **Separate concerns** - Data, UI, logic
- **Test incrementally** - Build and test features
- **User experience** - Make it intuitive
