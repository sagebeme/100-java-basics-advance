# Day 9 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 9 exercises and projects. This is where you begin working with HashMap and data structures for managing key-value pairs.

## 📁 Files Included

- `SecretAuction.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 9, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with arrays and ArrayLists
- **Ready** to work with key-value data structures
- **Curious** about HashMap and its uses
- **Unsure** about when to use HashMap vs arrays

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **HashMap Syntax**
   - Creating HashMap objects
   - put() and get() methods
   - Key-value pairs concept
   - **Tip**: HashMap stores pairs - key maps to value

2. **Finding Maximum**
   - Iterating through HashMap
   - Comparing values
   - Tracking maximum key-value pair
   - **Tip**: Loop through entries, compare values, track maximum

3. **Data Organization**
   - When to use HashMap
   - Organizing related data
   - Efficient data access
   - **Tip**: Use HashMap when you need to look up by key

### What to Focus On

✅ **HashMap operations** - put, get, iteration
✅ **Finding maximum** - Comparing and tracking values
✅ **Data organization** - Structuring information effectively
✅ **User input loop** - Collecting multiple entries

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 2-3 hours
- **HashMap**: Once you understand key-value concept, it's intuitive
- **Finding maximum**: Standard algorithm pattern

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Key-value pairs** - HashMap stores relationships
- **Efficient lookup** - Fast access by key
- **Iteration patterns** - Looping through entries
- **Maximum finding** - Compare and track algorithm

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Create and use HashMap
- [ ] Add and retrieve entries
- [ ] Iterate through HashMap
- [ ] Find maximum value

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **HashMap for lookups** - Perfect for name-value pairs
- **keySet() for iteration** - Get all keys, then get values
- **Track maximum as you go** - Compare during iteration
- **Clear variable names** - Makes HashMap usage clearer

**Remember**: HashMap is powerful for organizing related data! 🎉
