# Day 10 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 10 exercises and projects. This is where you begin working with return values and organizing code into well-structured methods.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Calculator.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 10, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with methods from previous days
- **Ready** to master return values
- **Curious** about organizing code into methods
- **Unsure** about when methods should return values

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Return Types**
   - Choosing correct return type
   - Returning vs void methods
   - Returning calculated values
   - **Tip**: Methods that compute should return results

2. **Method Organization**
   - Breaking code into logical methods
   - Each method does one thing
   - Methods work together
   - **Tip**: One method per operation (add, subtract, etc.)

3. **Method Calls**
   - Calling methods with parameters
   - Using return values
   - Storing results
   - **Tip**: Store return values in variables

### What to Focus On

✅ **Return statements** - Returning calculated values
✅ **Method organization** - Logical code structure
✅ **Method calls** - Using methods effectively
✅ **Code reusability** - Methods can be called multiple times

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 2-3 hours
- **Return values**: Once pattern is clear, becomes natural
- **Organization**: Takes practice to see method boundaries

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Return types** - Methods can give back results
- **Method organization** - Break code into logical units
- **Reusability** - Methods can be called multiple times
- **Clean code** - Well-organized methods are maintainable

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Write methods that return values
- [ ] Organize code into logical methods
- [ ] Call methods and use return values
- [ ] Structure code for readability

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **One method, one purpose** - Keep methods focused
- **Return calculated values** - Don't just print, return
- **Use meaningful names** - add(), subtract(), multiply()
- **Organize logically** - Related methods together

**Remember**: Well-organized code is easier to understand and maintain! 🎉
