## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **completed solutions** for Day 7 exercises and projects.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Hangman.java` - Complete Hangman game implementation

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Final State
After completing Day 7, you should now:
- **Understand** game state management
- **Know** how to track and display game progress
- **Be comfortable** with string manipulation in games
- **Grasp** complete game loop implementation

### What You've Learned

1. **Game State Management**
   - Tracking guessed letters with ArrayList
   - Managing lives/attempts counter
   - Checking word completion
   - Win/lose condition handling

2. **String Operations**
   - Checking if character is in string
   - Displaying word with blanks
   - Character-by-character processing
   - Building display strings

3. **Game Loop Design**
   - Main gameplay cycle
   - User input handling
   - Game state updates
   - Termination conditions

### Key Insights

- **ArrayList for tracking** - Easy to check and manage guesses
- **Character iteration** - Loop through word to check letters
- **State checking** - Verify win/lose after each turn
- **Clear user feedback** - Show progress and remaining lives

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Not checking for duplicates** - Prevent guessing same letter twice
❌ **Incorrect word display** - Show blanks and revealed letters correctly
❌ **Missing win condition** - Check if word is complete
❌ **Poor user feedback** - Always show current state

### Best Practices Demonstrated

✅ **Clear game structure** - Easy to follow logic
✅ **State management** - All variables tracked properly
✅ **User experience** - Clear prompts and feedback
✅ **Input validation** - Handle edge cases
✅ **Complete implementation** - All game features working

### Understanding the Learning Progression

**From Start to End:**
1. **Empty skeleton** → **Complete game**
2. **Basic arrays** → **Game state management**
3. **Simple loops** → **Complex game loop**
4. **Basic strings** → **Advanced string manipulation**

### What Makes This Solution Good

1. **Completeness** - All game features implemented
2. **Correctness** - Proper game logic
3. **Readability** - Clear structure
4. **User experience** - Engaging gameplay
5. **Best practices** - Follows Java conventions
