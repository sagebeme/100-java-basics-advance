# Day 23 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 23 exercises and projects. This is where you begin building the Turtle Crossing game with obstacles and levels.

## 📁 Files Included

- `TurtleCrossing.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 23, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with game development concepts
- **Ready** to build a level-based game
- **Curious** about obstacle management
- **Unsure** about level progression

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Obstacle Management**
   - Multiple moving obstacles
   - Spawning and despawning
   - Collision detection
   - **Tip**: Use ArrayList to manage multiple obstacles

2. **Level Progression**
   - Increasing difficulty
   - Level tracking
   - Resetting on level up
   - **Tip**: Increase obstacle count/speed with level

3. **Collision Handling**
   - Player-obstacle collision
   - Level completion detection
   - Game over conditions
   - **Tip**: Check all obstacles each frame

### What to Focus On

✅ **Obstacle system** - Multiple moving objects
✅ **Level progression** - Increasing difficulty
✅ **Collision detection** - Player vs obstacles
✅ **Game state** - Level, score, game over

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 3-4 hours
- **Obstacle management**: Takes practice
- **Level system**: Adds complexity

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Multiple objects** - ArrayList for obstacles
- **Level progression** - Increase difficulty over time
- **Collision detection** - Check all obstacles
- **Game state** - Track level and status

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Manage multiple obstacles
- [ ] Implement level progression
- [ ] Detect collisions
- [ ] Handle game state

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **ArrayList for obstacles** - Easy to add/remove
- **Level increases difficulty** - More obstacles, faster speed
- **Check all collisions** - Loop through obstacles
- **Reset on level up** - Return player to start
