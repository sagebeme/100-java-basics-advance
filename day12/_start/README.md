# Day 12 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 12 exercises and projects. This is where you begin working with variable scope, access modifiers, and difficulty levels.

## 📁 Files Included

- `NumberGuessingGame.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 12, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with variables and methods
- **Ready** to understand scope and access
- **Curious** about where variables can be accessed
- **Unsure** about access modifiers

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Variable Scope**
   - Where variables can be accessed
   - Local vs class-level variables
   - Scope boundaries
   - **Tip**: Variables exist only within their block

2. **Difficulty Levels**
   - Implementing different game modes
   - Adjusting game parameters
   - User choice handling
   - **Tip**: Use variables to control difficulty

3. **Loop Control**
   - Attempts tracking
   - Game continuation
   - Win/lose conditions
   - **Tip**: Track attempts, check conditions

### What to Focus On

✅ **Variable scope** - Understanding where variables exist
✅ **Difficulty implementation** - Adjusting game parameters
✅ **Attempt tracking** - Managing game attempts
✅ **User experience** - Clear difficulty selection

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 2-3 hours
- **Scope**: Once you understand blocks, it's clear
- **Difficulty**: Straightforward parameter adjustment

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Variable scope** - Variables exist in their block
- **Difficulty levels** - Adjust parameters for different modes
- **Attempt tracking** - Count and manage attempts
- **Game parameters** - Make games configurable

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Understand variable scope
- [ ] Implement difficulty levels
- [ ] Track attempts properly
- [ ] Handle win/lose conditions

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Variables in blocks** - Only accessible within their block
- **Difficulty as parameters** - Use variables to control difficulty
- **Track attempts** - Count down and check
- **Clear user prompts** - Explain difficulty options
