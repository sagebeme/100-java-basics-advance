## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 15, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with methods, variables, and control flow
- **Ready** to learn OOP basics
- **Curious** about class structure and state
- **Unsure** about resource management

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **OOP Concepts**
   - Class structure
   - Static variables
   - Method organization
   - State management
   - **Tip**: Think of class as blueprint, variables as state

2. **Resource Management**
   - Tracking resources (water, milk, coffee)
   - Checking availability
   - Deducting resources
   - **Tip**: Use variables to track resources, check before use

3. **State Management**
   - Maintaining machine state
   - Updating resources
   - Tracking money
   - **Tip**: Update state after each operation

4. **User Interaction**
   - Menu system
   - User choices
   - Input validation
   - **Tip**: Loop for menu, switch for choices

### What to Focus On

✅ **Class structure** - Organizing code in classes
✅ **State management** - Tracking resources and money
✅ **Resource checking** - Verify availability before use
✅ **User interface** - Clear menu and prompts

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 3-4 hours
- **OOP basics**: Takes time to understand class structure
- **State management**: Practice helps with tracking

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Class structure** - Organize related code
- **Static variables** - Shared state across methods
- **Resource management** - Track and update resources
- **State updates** - Modify state after operations

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Structure code in classes
- [ ] Manage resources and state
- [ ] Check resource availability
- [ ] Handle user interactions

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Static variables for state** - Shared across methods
- **Check before use** - Verify resources available
- **Update state** - Deduct resources after use
- **Clear menu** - User knows all options
