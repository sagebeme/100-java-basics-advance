# Day 7 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 7 exercises and projects. This is where you begin building the Hangman game - combining loops, arrays, and string manipulation.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Hangman.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 7, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with arrays, loops, and conditionals
- **Ready** to build a complete game
- **Curious** about game state management
- **Unsure** about tracking guessed letters and displaying word progress

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Game State Management**
   - Tracking guessed letters
   - Displaying word with blanks
   - Managing lives/attempts
   - **Tip**: Use ArrayList to track guesses, loop to display word

2. **String Manipulation**
   - Checking if letter is in word
   - Replacing blanks with letters
   - Displaying progress
   - **Tip**: Use char arrays or string building for display

3. **Game Logic Flow**
   - Main game loop
   - Win/lose conditions
   - User input validation
   - **Tip**: Break game into clear phases

### What to Focus On

✅ **Game loop structure** - Main gameplay cycle
✅ **State tracking** - Guessed letters, lives, word progress
✅ **String operations** - Checking and displaying letters
✅ **User experience** - Clear feedback and prompts

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 3-4 hours
- **Game logic**: Takes time to think through all cases
- **String manipulation**: Practice makes it easier

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Game loops** - Continuous gameplay until win/lose
- **State management** - Track all game variables
- **String checking** - Find letters in words
- **User feedback** - Clear messages for every action

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Create main game loop
- [ ] Track guessed letters
- [ ] Display word progress
- [ ] Handle win/lose conditions

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Use ArrayList for guesses** - Easy to check and add
- **Loop through word characters** - Check each letter
- **Clear display logic** - Show blanks and revealed letters
- **Test all scenarios** - Win, lose, invalid input
