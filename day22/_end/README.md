## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **completed solutions** for Day 22 exercises and projects.

## 📁 Files Included

- `PongGame.java` - Complete Pong game implementation

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Final State
After completing Day 22, you should now:
- **Understand** physics simulation in games
- **Know** how to implement two-player controls
- **Be comfortable** with collision detection
- **Grasp** complete game mechanics

### What You've Learned

1. **Physics Simulation**
   - Velocity vectors (speedX, speedY)
   - Ball movement
   - Bouncing mechanics
   - Speed control

2. **Two-Player System**
   - Separate key bindings
   - Independent paddle movement
   - Score tracking for each player
   - Player identification

3. **Collision Detection**
   - Ball-paddle collision
   - Ball-wall collision
   - Scoring detection
   - Boundary checking

### Key Insights

- **Velocity vectors** - Separate X and Y speeds
- **Bounce logic** - Reverse direction on collision
- **Two-player input** - Different keys per player
- **Scoring zones** - Detect ball passing paddle

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Wrong bounce direction** - Reverse correct axis
❌ **Paddle collision logic** - Check bounds correctly
❌ **Not resetting ball** - Reset after scoring
❌ **Poor physics** - Make movement feel natural

### Best Practices Demonstrated

✅ **Smooth physics** - Natural ball movement
✅ **Two-player controls** - Clear key bindings
✅ **Proper collision** - Accurate detection
✅ **Score tracking** - Both players tracked
✅ **Complete game** - All features working

### Understanding the Learning Progression

**From Start to End:**
1. **Empty skeleton** → **Complete Pong game**
