## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Graph Algorithms
Implement graph algorithms:

```java
public class GraphAlgorithms {
    public List<Integer> bfs(Graph graph, int start) {
        // Breadth-first search
    }
    
    public List<Integer> dfs(Graph graph, int start) {
        // Depth-first search
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Dynamic Programming
Use dynamic programming:

```java
public int fibonacci(int n) {
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```
