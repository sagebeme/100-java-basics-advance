# Day 24 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 24 exercises and projects. This is where you begin working with file I/O - reading and writing files.

## 📁 Files Included

- `MailMerge.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 24, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with console I/O
- **Ready** to work with files
- **Curious** about file operations
- **Unsure** about file paths and exceptions

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **File I/O Basics**
   - Reading from files
   - Writing to files
   - File paths
   - **Tip**: Use File, Scanner, FileWriter classes

2. **Exception Handling**
   - FileNotFoundException
   - IOException
   - Try-catch blocks
   - **Tip**: Always handle file exceptions

3. **Template Processing**
   - Reading templates
   - Replacing placeholders
   - Writing output files
   - **Tip**: Use string replace() method

### What to Focus On

✅ **File reading** - Scanner with File
✅ **File writing** - FileWriter class
✅ **Exception handling** - Try-catch for files
✅ **Template processing** - String manipulation

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 2-3 hours
- **File I/O**: Once pattern is clear, straightforward
- **Exception handling**: Important for robust code

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **File class** - Represents file path
- **Scanner for reading** - Read file line by line
- **FileWriter for writing** - Write to files
- **Exception handling** - Required for file operations

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Read from files
- [ ] Write to files
- [ ] Handle exceptions
- [ ] Process templates

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Always handle exceptions** - Files can fail
- **Close files** - Use try-with-resources
- **String replace()** - Easy placeholder replacement
- **File paths** - Relative or absolute paths
