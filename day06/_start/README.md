# Day 6 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 6 exercises and projects. This is where you begin working with methods - breaking code into reusable functions.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Maze.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 6, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with basic Java syntax and control flow
- **Ready** to organize code better
- **Curious** about methods and functions
- **Unsure** about method syntax and when to use them

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Method Syntax**
   - Return types vs void
   - Parameters vs arguments
   - Method naming conventions
   - **Tip**: Start with void methods, add return types later

2. **When to Create Methods**
   - Code organization
   - Reusability
   - Breaking down problems
   - **Tip**: If code is repeated, make it a method

3. **Method Design**
   - What should be a parameter?
   - What should be returned?
   - How to name methods clearly
   - **Tip**: Methods should do one thing well

### What to Focus On

✅ **Method declaration** - Syntax and structure
✅ **Parameters** - Passing data to methods
✅ **Return values** - Getting data back
✅ **Code organization** - Breaking problems into methods

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 2-3 hours
- **Methods**: Once you understand the pattern, it becomes natural
- **Organization**: Takes practice to see when to extract methods

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Methods organize code** - Reusable blocks
- **Parameters pass data** - Methods receive input
- **Return values** - Methods can give back results
- **Modular design** - Break problems into pieces

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Declare methods with proper syntax
- [ ] Use parameters effectively
- [ ] Return values from methods
- [ ] Organize code into logical methods

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **One method, one purpose** - Keep methods focused
- **Clear method names** - Describe what they do
- **Use parameters** - Make methods flexible
- **Return meaningful values** - Methods should be useful

**Remember**: Methods are the building blocks of organized code! 🎉
