# Day 18 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 18 exercises and projects. This is where you begin working with JavaFX graphics - creating visual applications and art.

## 📁 Files Included

- `HirstPainting.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 18, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with OOP and basic Java concepts
- **Ready** to create visual applications
- **Curious** about graphics programming
- **Unsure** about JavaFX setup and canvas drawing

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **JavaFX Setup**
   - Importing JavaFX libraries
   - Application class structure
   - Stage and Scene setup
   - **Tip**: JavaFX requires Application class and launch() method

2. **Canvas and GraphicsContext**
   - Understanding coordinate system
   - Drawing shapes and colors
   - GraphicsContext methods
   - **Tip**: (0,0) is top-left, x increases right, y increases down

3. **Visual Programming**
   - Thinking in pixels and coordinates
   - Color representation
   - Drawing patterns
   - **Tip**: Use loops to create patterns efficiently

### What to Focus On

✅ **JavaFX basics** - Application, Stage, Scene, Canvas
✅ **GraphicsContext** - Drawing methods (fillOval, fillRect, etc.)
✅ **Colors** - Using Color class and RGB values
✅ **Patterns** - Creating visual patterns with loops

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 2-3 hours
- **JavaFX setup**: Once configured, becomes routine
- **Graphics**: Practice makes drawing easier

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **JavaFX Application** - Extends Application, implements start()
- **Canvas** - Drawing surface for graphics
- **GraphicsContext** - Tool for drawing on canvas
- **Coordinate system** - Top-left origin, pixels as units

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Set up JavaFX application
- [ ] Create canvas and get GraphicsContext
- [ ] Draw basic shapes (circles, rectangles)
- [ ] Use colors effectively

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **JavaFX requires setup** - May need to configure in IDE
- **Use loops for patterns** - Efficient way to create art
- **Experiment with colors** - Try different RGB values
- **Coordinate system** - Remember (0,0) is top-left

**Remember**: Graphics programming is visual and rewarding! 🎉
