## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Final State
After completing Day 25, you should now:
- **Understand** CSV parsing and processing
- **Know** how to work with structured data
- **Be comfortable** with data-driven applications
- **Grasp** complete data processing workflow

### What You've Learned

1. **CSV Parsing**
   - Reading CSV files
   - Splitting by delimiter
   - Handling headers
   - Data extraction

2. **Data Processing**
   - Storing CSV data
   - Accessing data elements
   - Data validation
   - Search operations

3. **Data-Driven Applications**
   - Using CSV data in games
   - Dynamic content loading
   - Data validation
   - User interaction with data

### Key Insights

- **CSV is simple** - Just comma-separated values
- **split() method** - Easy parsing
- **ArrayList storage** - Efficient data management
- **Data validation** - Check against loaded data

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Not handling headers** - Skip or process separately
❌ **Wrong split logic** - Use split(",") correctly
❌ **Not validating data** - Check against loaded dataset
❌ **Poor error handling** - Handle file not found

### Best Practices Demonstrated

✅ **Proper CSV parsing** - Clean split logic
✅ **Data storage** - Efficient ArrayList usage
✅ **Data validation** - Check against dataset
✅ **User experience** - Clear prompts and feedback
✅ **Complete implementation** - All features working

### Understanding the Learning Progression

**From Start to End:**
1. **Empty skeleton** → **Complete data-driven game**
2. **No CSV** → **Full CSV processing**
3. **Basic structure** → **Data-driven application**
4. **Simple logic** → **Complex data handling**

### What Makes This Solution Good

1. **Completeness** - All CSV features
2. **Data processing** - Efficient parsing
3. **Game logic** - Well-implemented
4. **Code quality** - Clean and organized
5. **Best practices** - Follows Java conventions

### Next Steps After Reviewing
