# Day 13 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 13 exercises and projects. This is where you begin learning debugging - finding and fixing errors in code.

## 📁 Files Included

- `DebuggingChallenge.java` - Starter code with intentional bugs

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 13, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with Java syntax
- **Ready** to learn debugging skills
- **Curious** about common errors
- **Unsure** about how to find and fix bugs

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Syntax Errors**
   - Missing semicolons
   - Wrong variable types
   - Incorrect declarations
   - **Tip**: Read error messages carefully - they tell you what's wrong

2. **Finding Bugs**
   - Reading code carefully
   - Understanding error messages
   - Testing systematically
   - **Tip**: Compile often to catch errors early

3. **Fixing Errors**
   - Understanding the fix
   - Testing after fixing
   - Ensuring all bugs are fixed
   - **Tip**: Fix one error at a time, test after each fix

### What to Focus On

✅ **Error identification** - Finding all bugs
✅ **Understanding errors** - What error messages mean
✅ **Systematic fixing** - Fix one at a time
✅ **Testing** - Verify fixes work

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 1-2 hours
- **Debugging**: Skill improves with practice
- **Error messages**: Learn to read them effectively

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Syntax errors** - Code that doesn't compile
- **Error messages** - Compiler tells you what's wrong
- **Systematic debugging** - Find and fix methodically
- **Testing** - Verify fixes work

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Identify syntax errors
- [ ] Read error messages
- [ ] Fix errors systematically
- [ ] Test your fixes

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Read error messages** - They point to the problem
- **Fix one at a time** - Don't try to fix everything at once
- **Compile often** - Catch errors early
- **Test after fixing** - Make sure it works
