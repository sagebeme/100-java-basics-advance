# Day 8 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 8 exercises and projects. This is where you begin working with method parameters, character manipulation, and encryption.

## 📁 Files Included

- `CaesarCipher.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 8, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with methods from Day 6
- **Ready** to work with character manipulation
- **Curious** about encryption algorithms
- **Unsure** about character arithmetic and shifting

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Character Manipulation**
   - Converting between char and int
   - Character arithmetic (shifting)
   - Handling uppercase vs lowercase
   - **Tip**: Characters are numbers - you can do math with them

2. **Encryption Logic**
   - Understanding Caesar cipher
   - Wrapping around alphabet (Z → A)
   - Encoding vs decoding
   - **Tip**: Encoding shifts forward, decoding shifts backward

3. **Method Parameters**
   - Passing data to methods
   - Using parameters effectively
   - Return values from methods
   - **Tip**: Parameters make methods flexible and reusable

### What to Focus On

✅ **Character operations** - Math with characters
✅ **Alphabet wrapping** - Modulo for circular shift
✅ **Method design** - Separate encode/decode methods
✅ **String processing** - Character-by-character transformation

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 2-3 hours
- **Character math**: Once you understand ASCII, it's straightforward
- **Encryption logic**: Takes practice to get wrapping right

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Characters are numbers** - Can do arithmetic
- **Modulo for wrapping** - (char - 'A' + shift) % 26 + 'A'
- **Method separation** - Encode and decode as separate methods
- **String building** - Construct result character by character

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Perform character arithmetic
- [ ] Handle alphabet wrapping
- [ ] Create encode/decode methods
- [ ] Process strings character by character

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Use modulo for wrapping** - Handles Z → A automatically
- **Separate encode/decode** - Cleaner code organization
- **Handle case separately** - Uppercase and lowercase have different bases
- **Test with known examples** - Verify encryption works correctly

**Remember**: Character manipulation opens up many possibilities! 🎉
