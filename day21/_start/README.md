# Day 21 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 21 exercises and projects. This is where you complete the Snake game with food, collision, and scoring.

## 📁 Files Included

- `CompleteSnakeGame.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 21, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with Snake game foundation from Day 20
- **Ready** to add game features
- **Curious** about collision detection
- **Unsure** about food spawning and scoring

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Food System**
   - Spawning food randomly
   - Checking food collision
   - Respawn after eating
   - **Tip**: Use Random for positions, check if snake head == food position

2. **Collision Detection**
   - Wall collisions
   - Self collisions
   - Food collisions
   - **Tip**: Check boundaries and compare positions

3. **Scoring System**
   - Tracking score
   - Updating display
   - Game over condition
   - **Tip**: Increment score on food collision, check collisions each frame

### What to Focus On

✅ **Food spawning** - Random positions, collision checking
✅ **Collision detection** - Walls, self, food
✅ **Scoring** - Track and display score
✅ **Game over** - Handle end conditions

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 3-4 hours
- **Collision detection**: Takes practice to get right
- **Game logic**: Complex but rewarding

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Collision detection** - Position comparison
- **Random spawning** - Food placement
- **Game state** - Track score and game status
- **Game over logic** - End game conditions

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Spawn food randomly
- [ ] Detect collisions
- [ ] Track score
- [ ] Handle game over

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Collision = position match** - Compare coordinates
- **Random food** - Use grid-based positions
- **Check collisions first** - Before updating position
- **Game over screen** - Display final score

**Remember**: Complete games are satisfying achievements! 🎉
