# Day 1 - Working with Variables in Java to Manage Data

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Java variables and data types
- Learn how to declare and initialize variables
- Practice variable naming conventions
- Work with primitive data types (int, double, boolean, char)
- Understand type conversion and casting

## Topics Covered
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Primitive data types
- Naming conventions
- Type conversion
- Constants (final keyword)

## Exercises
1. Create variables for different data types
2. Perform basic operations with variables
3. Print variables to console
4. Practice type conversion

## Project: Band Name Generator
Create a simple program that generates a band name based on user input.

### Requirements
- Ask user for their city name
- Ask user for their pet's name
- Combine them to create a band name
- Display the result

### Example Output
```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator!
What city did you grow up in?
Boston
What's your pet's name?
Max
Your band name could be: Boston Max
```

## Key Concepts
- **Variables**: Containers for storing data values
- **Data Types**: int, double, boolean, char, String
- **Scanner**: For reading user input
- **System.out.println()**: For displaying output

## Next Steps
After completing Day 1, you should be comfortable with:
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Reading user input
- Displaying output
- Basic data type operations
