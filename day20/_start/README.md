# Day 20 - Starting Point 🚀

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains the **starting code** for Day 20 exercises and projects. This is where you begin building the foundation for the Snake game.

## 📁 Files Included

- `SnakeGame.java` - Starter code for the main project

## 🎯 Learning Curve & Notes

### Initial State
When you start Day 20, you're likely:
- **Familiar** with JavaFX and animation
- **Ready** to build a complete game
- **Curious** about game mechanics
- **Unsure** about keyboard input and movement

### Common Starting Challenges

1. **Keyboard Input**
   - Handling key presses
   - Setting focus on canvas
   - Direction changes
   - **Tip**: Use setOnKeyPressed() and setFocusTraversable(true)

2. **Movement System**
   - Tracking snake segments
   - Updating positions
   - Direction management
   - **Tip**: Use ArrayList to store segments, update head position

3. **Game Loop**
   - Continuous updates
   - Rendering each frame
   - Timing control
   - **Tip**: Use Thread.sleep() to control game speed

### What to Focus On

✅ **Keyboard input** - Handling user input
✅ **Movement logic** - Updating positions based on direction
✅ **Game loop** - Continuous update and render
✅ **State tracking** - Managing snake segments

### Time Expectations

- **First time**: 3-4 hours
- **Game mechanics**: Takes time to get right
- **Movement**: Once pattern is clear, becomes easier

### Key Concepts to Grasp

- **Keyboard events** - setOnKeyPressed() for input
- **ArrayList for segments** - Dynamic snake body
- **Direction vectors** - (x, y) direction changes
- **Game loop** - Update state, then render

### Before Moving Forward

Make sure you can:
- [ ] Handle keyboard input
- [ ] Update snake position
- [ ] Render snake on screen
- [ ] Control game speed

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Focus on canvas** - setFocusTraversable(true)
- **ArrayList for body** - Easy to add/remove segments
- **Direction vectors** - Simple way to handle movement
- **Control speed** - Thread.sleep() controls frame rate
